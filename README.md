Configurations of my daily utils.

- Neovim
- Zsh
- Ghostty
- SkillHub CLI
- Declared Codex plugins and standalone skills
- ShellCheck validation
- Offline bundle builder for GitHub Actions artifacts

## Setup

This repo currently maintains Neovim, Zsh, and Ghostty configs, uv-managed user-level Python, Node.js with
pnpm, SkillHub CLI setup, and declarative Codex plugin and skill lists.

```sh
./setup.sh
```

The script installs Neovim nightly, Zsh tooling, uv with Python 3.14 as the user-level default,
Node.js with pnpm for JavaScript dependencies, the SkillHub CLI, the plugins and skills declared in
`codex-packages.json`, and backs up existing config files before replacing them with links to this
repo. It is safe to rerun; existing links, plugins, skills, and tools are detected and skipped.

- Arch Linux: bootstraps `paru` when needed, then installs `neovim-git`.
- macOS and other Linux distributions: uses Homebrew to install Neovim HEAD.
- Zsh: uses Starship for the prompt, Antidote for plugin management, and F-Sy-H for syntax
  highlighting.
- Ghostty: links `ghostty/config` to `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/ghostty/config`, backing up an
  existing config before replacing it. Install Ghostty 1.3+ and the Maple Mono NF font separately.
  The config uses a transparent background, command-finished notifications, and a bottom Quick
  Terminal opened with `Alt+Space` on the display under the mouse pointer.
- Python: installs uv through Homebrew or `paru`, then exposes uv-managed Python 3.14 as `python`
  and `python3` through `~/.local/bin`. The operating system Python remains unchanged.
- Node.js: installs Node.js and pnpm through Homebrew or `paru`; use pnpm for project dependency
  installation and lockfiles.
- SkillHub: installs the CLI through the upstream `--cli-only` bootstrap. Skills using the
  `skillhub` installer are installed into `~/.agents/skills`.
- Codex plugins: installs `PLUGIN@MARKETPLACE` selectors from the `plugins` array. Bundled and
  runtime marketplaces are supplied by Codex. For Agent Toolbox, setup preserves unrelated entries
  in `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and adds a Git-backed entry to the personal marketplace.
- Standalone skills: the `skills` array records each skill's name, installer, and any required
  revision or reference. Local-only entries are inventoried but cannot be recreated when their
  source directory is absent.
- Agent Reach: verifies the uv tool's installed Git commit, reinstalls the pinned upstream revision
  when needed, registers its skill non-interactively, then reapplies
  `patches/agent-reach-xiaohongshu-only.patch` so only explicit Xiaohongshu access triggers the
  skill. Setup stops instead of forcing the patch if a future upstream revision no longer matches
  it.
- Shell scripts: installs ShellCheck for local validation.
- Surge: when selected and `/Applications/Surge.app/Contents/Resources/Skills/surge` is available,
  links it to
  `$CODEX_HOME/skills/surge` (or `~/.codex/skills/surge` by default) so the skill stays current with
  Surge app updates.

## Offline Bundle

The Go command under `cmd/dotfiles` is only used to build GitHub Actions artifacts. It is not
installed by `setup.sh`.

The daily workflow builds a single multi-call payload for constrained environments:

```sh
go build -trimpath -o /tmp/dotfiles-pack ./cmd/dotfiles
/tmp/dotfiles-pack pack -o cmd/dotfiles/payload
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags embedded -trimpath -o dotfiles-env ./cmd/dotfiles
rm -rf cmd/dotfiles/payload
./dotfiles-env list
./dotfiles-env apply
```

The bundle artifact is a Go binary with the payload embedded through Go's `embed` package, so it
does not require `tar`, `base64`, network access, or sudo on the target host. Daily GitHub Actions
builds publish native artifacts for `linux-amd64`, `darwin-arm64`, and `darwin-amd64`. Each artifact
includes the dotfiles payload plus portable user-space tools downloaded by `scripts/fetch-tools.sh`,
including the latest Neovim nightly for that platform from the daily workflow run.
The payload includes the Ghostty config, and `apply` installs it alongside the shell and editor configs.

On an offline host:

```sh
chmod +x dotfiles-env-linux-amd64
./dotfiles-env-linux-amd64 apply
./dotfiles-env-linux-amd64 tool list
./dotfiles-env-linux-amd64 tool nvim --version
./dotfiles-env-linux-amd64 tool rg --version
```

Machine-local Zsh settings, including secrets, proxies, and host-specific paths,
belong in `~/.config/zsh/local.zsh`. That file is sourced by `.zshrc` and is
not tracked by this repo.

Preview changes without writing:

```sh
./setup.sh --dry-run
```

Install only the config links and skip install/update work:

```sh
./setup.sh --skip-neovim-install --skip-zsh-install --skip-python-install \
  --skip-node-install --skip-skillhub-install --skip-skill-install \
  --skip-plugin-install
```

Skip uv and user-level Python installation:

```sh
./setup.sh --skip-python-install
```

Skip Node.js and pnpm installation:

```sh
./setup.sh --skip-node-install
```

Skip SkillHub CLI installation:

```sh
./setup.sh --skip-skillhub-install
```

Choose the Codex plugins and standalone skills installed by normal setup in the single
`codex-packages.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "plugins": [
    "browser@openai-bundled"
  ],
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "example-skill",
      "installer": "skillhub",
      "reference": "@example-team/example-skill"
    },
    {
      "name": "agent-reach",
      "installer": "uv-tool",
      "revision": "GIT_REVISION"
    },
    {
      "name": "surge",
      "installer": "app"
    }
  ]
}
```

The schema version is currently `1`. Plugin entries use `PLUGIN@MARKETPLACE`. Skill installers are
`skillhub`, the pinned `uv-tool` form used for Agent Reach, `app` for Surge, and `local` for an
inventory-only skill already available on a machine. A string skill entry is shorthand for a
SkillHub reference.

Use `--packages-file` to select a different JSON file. You can also add entries for one setup run by
repeating `--skill` or `--plugin`:

```sh
./setup.sh --packages-file ~/.config/dotfiles/codex-packages.json
./setup.sh --skill example-skill --plugin browser@openai-bundled
```

Setup skips valid SkillHub skills already present in `~/.agents/skills`, the legacy
`$CODEX_HOME/skills` directory, or SkillHub's install record. Agent Reach is checked against its
declared Git revision, and Surge is checked against the authoritative application-bundle symlink.
The checked-in JSON reflects the plugins and standalone skills currently enabled on this machine.
To skip either category for one setup run:

```sh
./setup.sh --skip-skill-install
./setup.sh --skip-plugin-install
```

`--install-agent-toolbox` remains as a compatibility alias that adds Agent Toolbox to the requested
plugin set.

## Tooling Decisions

- [agnix evaluation](docs/decisions/agnix.md): keep the dependency out of the managed setup for
  now; reconsider a pinned CLI-only trial if its diagnostics become necessary.

## Validation

```sh
bash -n setup.sh
bash -n scripts/fetch-tools.sh
shellcheck setup.sh scripts/fetch-tools.sh
python3 -m json.tool codex-packages.json >/dev/null
git apply --numstat patches/agent-reach-xiaohongshu-only.patch >/dev/null
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s tests

rm -rf cmd/dotfiles/payload
zsh -n zsh/zshenv zsh/zprofile zsh/zshrc
```

Or run all local checks with:

```sh
make validate
```
